Feel free to use this to create you own card games or use the build artifcats/releases to order a set at a card printing company. You may also sell the sets under the aforementioned license agreements for your own profit, BUT you need to make sure that you are allowed to use the images, yourself.

The code is rather unorganised and chaotic, but I might fix this in the future.
